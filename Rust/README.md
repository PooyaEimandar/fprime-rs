# fprime-rs

Incremental Rust port of F´ components, keeping FPP as the source of truth and
mixed C++/Rust deployments working at every step.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 0 — Skeleton**: cargo workspace, `fprime-config` generated from
      the FPP config, wire-compatible `no_std` codec, panic→`FW_ASSERT` bridge,
      CMake/cargo integration, differential UT green under `fprime-util check`
- [x] **Phase 1 — Foundation libraries**: CircularBuffer byte engine, CRC32,
      and CFDP checksum in Rust behind unchanged C++ headers, existing UTs as
      oracle; per-module `FPRIME_RUST_IMPL_*` rollback switches proven both
      ways (Queue's orchestration stays C++ atop the Rust engine — its header
      encapsulation blocks direct porting until Phase 4 codegen)
- [x] **Phase 2 — First components**: `Svc/FprimeDeframer` and
      `Svc/FprimeFramer` logic in Rust (`fprime-svc` crate) behind unchanged
      component classes; the framer calls the `bufferAllocate` returning port
      from inside Rust via a trampoline; component UTs green Rust-backed, and
      the Ref GDS integration suite (11 tests) passes against the mixed
      deployment (Ref's CCSDS stack runs the Phase 1 Rust engine; these two
      components serve ComFprime-based deployments)
- [x] **Phase 3 — Stateful data path**: `FrameAccumulator`'s full
      accumulate/detect/extract orchestration in Rust driving the component
      through a 13-callback trampoline table (ring, detector, allocation,
      events); `FprimeRouter`'s buffer-context table state machine in Rust
      over the C++-resident entries; ring engine made overlap-tolerant
      (raw-pointer per-byte copy, matching the C++ loop) after in-tree
      detector tests exposed self-serialization; all suites green and Ref GDS
      integration 11/11 with the Rust orchestration live in the uplink
- [x] **Phase 4 — Codegen (types)**: `tools/fprime-rs/fpp_to_rust.py` generates
      Rust structs/enums/arrays from FPP models via `fpp-to-json` (the FPP
      compiler is never modified), folding `default` clauses through FPP's own
      `valueMap` and emitting `SERIALIZED_SIZE` to match the autocode;
      `cmake/autocoder/rust.cmake` implements the autocoder plugin contract to
      verify the checked-in generated code against its model at build time
      (`-DFPRIME_RUST_AUTOCODE=ON`, exercised in CI). **Scope, stated plainly:**
      this generates *types*, not component handlers or FFI glue — a new
      component still needs hand-written shims (component generation is Phase 7
      work). Differential coverage is `Svc/FprimeProtocol` (flat U32 structs)
      and `default/config/ComCfg` (enums with explicit reprs and `default`
      clauses, a nine-member struct with defaults, nested enums, bools, several
      integer widths), each compared default-constructed, round-tripped, and on
      `SERIALIZED_SIZE`, in both endianness modes. **Not yet covered by a
      differential test:** arrays, floats, 64-bit members, and member arrays —
      the generator handles them and they have generator-level tests, but no
      byte-for-byte comparison against autocode. String members are refused
      with a clear error. The retrofit onto generated types is the deframer's
      header parse and the protocol size constants; the trailer read and the
      framer's writes are still hand-rolled.
- [ ] **Phase 5 — Active components and drivers**: `Svc/ComQueue`, then
      I2C/UART/GPIO drivers after characterization tests (known defect fixes
      land as reviewed, test-pinned divergences)
- [ ] **Phase 6 — Qualification hardening**: Ferrocene toolchain option,
      Safety-Critical Rust coding guidelines
- [ ] **Phase 7 — Rust-native component runtime**: full components generated in
      Rust (dispatch, queues, cmd/tlm/event plumbing); no per-component C++
- [ ] **Phase 8 — `Fw` core in Rust**: serialization/types/buffers become the
      canonical Rust crates; C++ consumes them via reverse shims (the flip point)
- [ ] **Phase 9 — OSAL in Rust + component long tail**: port what deployments
      actually instantiate
- [ ] **Phase 10 — Drop the C++ toolchain** (per deployment): no fpp-to-cpp, no
      C++ objects, cargo-only build
